2carray
=======

A simple utility to encode a file (or any other data) into a C byte array.

Having [set up your Go environment](http://golang.org/doc/install), simply run

    go get github.com/cratonica/2carray

Then use by piping a file into the utility and capturing the output. You must provide a name for the generate array symbol. For example:

    $GOPATH/bin/2carray my_image < myimage.png > my_image.h

This will output something like:

    #ifndef MY_IMAGE_H_INCLUDED
    #define MY_IMAGE_H_INCLUDED

    const unsigned char my_image[] = {
      0x49, 0x20, 0x63, 0x61, 0x6e, 0x27, 0x74, 0x20, 0x62, 0x65, 0x6c, 0x69, 
      0x65, 0x76, 0x65, 0x20, 0x79, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x20, 0x61, 0x63, 0x74, 0x75, 
      0x61, 0x6c, 0x6c, 0x79, 0x20, 0x64, 0x65, 0x63, 0x6f, 0x64, 0x65, 0x64, 
      0x20, 0x74, 0x68, 0x69, 0x73, 0x2e, 0x20, 0x4b, 0x75, 0x64, 0x6f, 0x73, 
      0x20, 0x66, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x20, 0x62, 0x65, 0x69, 0x6e, 0x67, 0x20, 0x74, 
      0x68, 0x6f, 0x72, 0x6f, 0x75, 0x67, 0x68, 0x2e, 0x0a
    };

    #endif /* MY_IMAGE_H_INCLUDED */
